// Namaste DSA by Akshay Saini

// BATCH 1 Introduction

// What is DSA?
// Data Structures - how data is stored (array, string, list, etc.)
// Algorithms - steps to solve a problem efficiently

// Goal of DSA is to Solve problems correctly + efficiently

// Why JavaScript for DSA?
// Same logic works for interviews
// JS arrays, objects are very powerful
// Focus more on logic than syntax

// How to Approach Any DSA Problem?
// Always ask -
// What is the input?
// What is the output?
// Can I solve it step by step?
// Can I reduce unnecessary work?

// This mindset matters more than code.
